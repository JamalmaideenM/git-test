1.application load balancer
2.network load balancer
3.gateway load balancer
4.classic load balancer

Route53:
DNS- Domain Name System
53 - DNS port number
what are the routing policies are in R53?
1.create record-routing policy
  1.simple routing    - 
  2.weighted          -
  3.geolocation       - same dns name - different content depends on the region (geolocation)
  4.latency           - user in chennai app/web runs in mumbai&singapore region (user access nearest region)its called latency - quick response
  5.failover          - health check mendatery primary/secondary setup (primary will down secondary will take the responsibilities)
  6.multivalue answer -
2.configure records-define simple records
  1.A type     - ip4 version
  2.AA type    - ip6 version
  3.CNAME type - hit www.greens.com - go www.amazon.com (user hits the greens page-greens hits the amazon page)
3.DNS Resolver
  user hits the dns name (specified app/web),the resolver is converts dns name to ip address of the specified app/web
  www.amazon.com -(dns resolver)- 172.32.57.013
  1.TTL- time to live
  dns name mapping the ip adsress (specified app/web)
  user hits the dns name of the specified app/web the caches are lives in dns resolver to defined time interval is a ttl
  TTL- min-1min max-2days 
ELB&ASG:
========
EC2-load balancer
   -auto scaling
AMI-Amazon Machine Image-image of your machine(an executable image of an already existing ec2 instance)
snapshot-volume backup on ec2 instance
EBS-elastic block storage(add a addtional volumes on your instance)
elastic load balancer:
i have a one applivcation,it runs in 3 servers(vir.mach)
here, that 3 servers are dedicated to load balance
whenever the bulk or huge traffics(requests/users) are came the load balancer to split the requests to each servers
(automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple virtual machines/servers)
types of load balancer
1.classic (osi-open system interconnection model)
2.application
3.network
4.gateway
load balancer is checks the servers health is good or week(health check)
health check in load balancer is one of the advantage
